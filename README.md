# Top-Down RPG Mini-Project

This first 2D Top-Down RPG project taught us how to build basic behaviours and interactions.

* Programming standard **State Machine** for our player and enemies behaviours;
* Building a **tile based collisions system**;
* Adding multiple items thus interactions (throw arrows, chop wood, break rocks);
* Basic **dialogs and quests system**;
* Displaying **basic UI** information for items, loots and health;
